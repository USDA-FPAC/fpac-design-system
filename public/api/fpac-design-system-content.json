      "transcript": "<h2>Prototype Kit Training</h2><br>1. Hello, my name is Casey Hill. I am a User Experience Architect for FBCSS, and today’s training will show you how to download and install the Prototype Kit version 1.<br><br>2. Before you get started, you will need to have Node version 12 or above and Node Package Manager, version 6 or above, installed on your computer.<br><br>3. Node Package Manager, also known as NPM, is used to manage the installation and build process for the Prototype Kit.<br><br>4. Feel free to hit pause on the video now, Once Node is installed on your machine, you are ready to continue.<br><br>5. The Prototype Kit is a design tool kit that can be used to quickly build high-fidelity HTML prototypes that run in your browser.<br><br>6. The Prototype Kit uses the FPAC Design System as a dependency, which will allow your prototypes to utilize the same look and feel as production ready applications.<br><br>7. Let’s get started.<br><br>8. Open a web browser and navigate to github.com/usda-fsa.<br><br>9. Within the list of repositories, click on the fsa prototype kit.<br><br>10. On the right side of the screen you will see a green dropdown button with a label that reads Clone or Download.<br><br>11. Click the button to open the dropdown panel, and either highlight or click on the Copy to Clipboard button.<br><br>12. Either within your IDE or with a Command Prompt, change directories to where you store the source files for your projects. <br><br>13. Clone the Prototype Kit repo into a new directory by typing<br><br>14. git clone Paste the URL from the clipboard and then provide a directory name for your application and hit enter.<br><br>15. The Prototype Kit project files will be downloaded to your computer<br><br>16. Back in Terminal change directories into the newly created application project directory by typing cd and the name you provided<br><br>17. Next, type npm install and hit enter.<br><br>18. It can take between 2 and 15 minutes to install all of the dependencies, so feel free to pause the video until they are completely installed.<br><br>19. A directory was added with the name of node_modules, which contains all of the required dependencies.<br><br>20. If no errors occur during this process, you are ready to build the application.<br><br>21. Type npm run build<br><br>22. This will run webpack’s build process which creates a new directory named dist.<br><br>23. Dist contains all of the files that are required to run the Prototype locally on a web server.<br><br>24. This process could take a couple minutes to complete.<br><br>25. Once built, you can type npm run start to enable and run a local web server.<br><br>26. This will automatically launch a new browser and the Sample application at localhost and running on port 8888.<br><br>27. As you can see, the application is now fully functional and you can begin building your own prototype applications."
