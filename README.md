# FPAC Design System

The FPAC Design System is open source and available to the general public. It consists of two core repositories, both hosted on GitHub.

1. **[FDS Style](https://github.com/USDA-FPAC/fds-style/)**: This is a CSS Framework implementation of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to implement the look and feel of the FPAC Design System.
2. **[FPAC Design System (FDS)](https://github.com/USDA-FPAC/fpac-design-system/)**: This is the source code for the design system which is based on FDS Style and its accompanying guidelines. It includes a wealth of information including components, variations, code snippets, and guidelines for proper usage.

## Background

This resource was made for use by product teams in FPAC (Farm Production and Conservation - a USDA Mission Area) who want to create beautiful, easy-to-use, and consistent online experiences. It supports the requirements of [OMB Memorandum M-16-21](https://open.gsa.gov/oss-policy/), “Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software". This policy requires agencies to develop plans to release at least 20 percent of new custom-developed source code as Open Source Software (OSS) when commissioning new custom software.

The FPAC Design System was created and is maintained within FPAC's ISSDOB/FBCSS (Information Services Delivery and Operations Branch / FPAC Business Center Support Services). It was initially influenced by the `v1.x.x` version of the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/). It follows industry-standard web accessibility guidelines and uses the best practices of existing style libraries and modern web design.

## FPAC Design System vs. FSA Design System

The FPAC Design System supersedes the FSA Design System. **Please note that both the FSA Design System and FSA Style have been deprecated and are no longer supported.**
